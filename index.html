            <h2>Ise Grand Shrine</h2>
            <p>
                Ise Grand Shrine, officially called Ise Jingu, is a shrine dedicated to the celestial sun goddess Amaterasu(Amaterasu-Omikami). The area is roughly the same size as the center of Paris. More than 1,500 rituals are preformed yearly for the Imperial family, for world peace and the hugh harvest. Originally Amaterasu-Omikami was worshiped in the Imperial Palace until the reign of the 10th Emperor Sujin, who moved the Holy Mirror (the symbol of Amaterasu-Omikami) out of the Imperial Palace.
                <br>
                Then, during the reign of the 11th Emperor Suinin, the Emperor ordered his princess, Yamatohime-no-mikoto, to seek out the most appropriate place to permanently inshrine and worship Amaterasu-Omikami. After a long time of searching the princess received a revelation that the best place to worship nad inshrine Amaterasu-Omikami was in Ise. That was approximately 2,000 years ago.
